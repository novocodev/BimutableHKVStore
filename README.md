# HashedValueStore
A Key/Value store where the key is derived by using a hash function of the value. Values are arbitrary binary blobs.

 The hash function may generate immutable or mutable keys 
 
 # Immutable keys
 
 For a given hash function, the same value will always generate the same key. Immutable keys can be used to provide content addressing of data blocks and may be used as the builing blocks of a merkel DAG.
 
 # Mutable keys
 
 For a given hash function, the key is generated by hashing a unique public key from a public/private key pair, the value in the store associated with the public key is signed using the private key.
 
 This allows a singe key to reference any value, but anyone looking up the key can validate that only the owner of the public/private key pair could have written the data.
 
 # HashedValueStore
 
 A HashedValueStore can be used as a core component when developing highly distributed systems that have no central authority or coordination and where peers need to be able to independently validate data.
 
 This repo contains interface definitions for the HashedValueStore in the following languages.
 
 Java
