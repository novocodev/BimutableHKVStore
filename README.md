# HashedValueStore
A Key/Value store where the key is derived by using a hash function of the value. Values are arbitrary binary blobs.

 The hashed function may generate immutable or mutable keys 
 
 # Immutable keys
 
For a given hash function, the same value will always generate the same key. Immutable keys can be used to provide content addressing of data blocks and may be used as the builing blocks of a merkel DAG.
 
 # Mutable keys
 
 For a given hash function, the key is generated by hashing a unique public key, the associated value is signed with the same key.
 
 This means that the same key can reference any value, it also means that the same key may reference many values in the store.
 
 Mutable keys are often used to provide a naming service, which can reference different immutable blocks over time.
 
 # HashedValueStore
 
 A HashedValueStore can be used as a core component when developing highly distributed systems that have no central authority or coordination and peers need to be able to validate data.
 
 This repo contains interface definitions for the HashedValueStore in the following languages.
 
 Java
